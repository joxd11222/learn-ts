// Hello! In this repository you'll learn basics of TypeScript

// 1. What's it?

/*
TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types, classes, and modules to the language. 
TypeScript is designed to help developers catch errors early in the development process and make code more maintainable.
*/

/*

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

*/

// Let's make an example in typescript code

// You need to create a file with the extension .ts

const message = "Hello, World"
console.log(message)

let test1 = 1 // This is a number variable

// Run this code with node "the name of your file".ts

// This script creates a variable of type string and logs it in the output.

// In the next episode we'll create classes.
